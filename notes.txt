When implementing a new feature, generate a new branch on the repository

Prepend the branch name with "feature"
add only one feature per new branch. 
once everything is working merge it back into the master branch.  


To do this week:
	- Support Trial reordering
	- Support buttonmenu expanding on hover
	- Add AppBar accross the top. 
	- Preview in the middle.
